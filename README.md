# Predicting Credit Score (WIP)

## Short Description
Looking at a dataset taken from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parisrohan/credit-score-classification), can I build a ML model to accurately predict someones credit score.

## Current Status
Presently just cleaning up the data such that I can start building different ML models and test how accurately I can predict someone's credit score.
Already I can see areas in which I have approximated missing data and therefore there is potential to alter how I deal with this missing data and consequently this could improve (or make worse) my ML models but we shall see.
Plan is to test a Neural Network using TensorFlow but as the dataset has just 3 categories for credit score (good, standard, poor) I will also look into the models provided by Scikit-Learn.
